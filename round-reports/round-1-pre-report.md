## This Weekend's Research

### Testing Results (Bahrain Pre-Season, completed Feb 20)
1. **Leclerc** (Ferrari) — 1:31.992 (fastest of ALL testing)
2. **Antonelli** (Mercedes) — 1:32.803
3. **Piastri** (McLaren) — 1:32.861
4. **Norris** (McLaren) — 1:32.871
5. **Verstappen** (Red Bull) — 1:33.109
6. **Russell** (Mercedes) — 1:33.197 (but Mercedes topped mileage charts — 21,515 km)
7. **Hamilton** (Ferrari) — 1:33.408
8. **Gasly** (Alpine) — 1:33.421
9. **Bearman** (Haas) — 1:33.487

**Key takeaways:**
- Mercedes completed by far the most mileage (21,515 km) suggesting strong reliability and race trim focus over headline times
- Ferrari set the outright fastest lap, suggesting genuine pace
- McLaren look competitive but admitted they're "3rd/4th" in the pecking order
- Russell (our DRS Boost target) was 6th fastest but at the team suspected of hiding the most pace

### Weather Forecast (Melbourne, March 7-8)
- **Saturday (Qualifying):** Dry, 18-19°C, 0% rain probability, moderate southerly winds (20-22 km/h)
- Melbourne can be unpredictable but current forecasts suggest a dry weekend

### Grid Penalties & News
- **Bottas: 5-place grid penalty** at Melbourne (from 2024 Abu Dhabi incident). This is confirmed and will be served.
  - Fantasy impact: Qualifying points unaffected. Race start position lowered → more potential positions gained (+1 each). Could be a slight net positive for fantasy.
- **New Straight Mode zones** replacing DRS at Albert Park — some safety concerns raised but FIA adjusting procedures
- **Start procedure extended by 5 seconds** due to turbo spool-up issues most teams experienced in testing (all except Ferrari)
- No other penalties or injuries reported

### Expert Predictions
- Russell and Verstappen are early betting favourites for the Australian GP
- No clearly dominant car emerging from testing — seven drivers considered genuine title contenders
- Melbourne's bumpy surface and green track early in the weekend reward adaptable setups

## Strategic Analysis & Confidence Scores

### Current Team Assessment
Our team (GPT RS) is broadly well-constructed for Round 1:
- **Russell** (27.5 xPts, DRS Boost) — highest xPts driver, likely fastest car. **STRONG HOLD.**
- **Leclerc** (22.3 xPts) — fastest in testing, great value at $22.8M vs $27M+ premiums. **STRONG HOLD.**
- **Bearman** (5.2 xPts, +$0.03 xΔ$) — Haas tested well, 58% ownership is risky if he disappoints but upside is there. **HOLD.**
- **Bottas** (4.3 xPts, +$0.25 xΔ$) — Best price growth in the game. Grid penalty may help with positions gained. **HOLD.**
- **Hulkenberg** (0.8 xPts, -$0.37 xΔ$) — **THE WEAK LINK.** Low expected points AND likely price crash. 71% chance of losing $0.6M.
- **Ferrari constructor** (56.6 xPts, +$0.27 xΔ$) — 92% rise chance. Best value constructor. **STRONG HOLD.**
- **Racing Bulls constructor** (~8.8 xPts, +$0.24 xΔ$) — Decent budget constructor. **HOLD.**

### Hulkenberg Decision (Key Question for Round 1 Run)
**Current:** Hulkenberg ($6.8M, 0.8 xPts, -$0.37 xΔ$)
**Alternatives within budget ($0.1M remaining + $6.8M Hulkenberg sell = $6.9M max):**

| Option | Price | xPts | xΔ$ | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------|------|-----|------|------|
| Keep Hulkenberg | $6.8M | 0.8 | -0.37 | No transfer used | Lowest xPts, price crash likely |
| Lawson | $6.5M | 1.9 | -0.17 | Higher xPts, less price drop | Still negative xΔ$ |
| Bortoleto | $6.4M | ~1.5 | ~-0.20 | Audi teammate, cheaper | Rookie, uncertain |
| Lindblad | $6.2M | ~2.0 | ~0.00 | Racing Bulls synergy | True rookie, risky |
| Colapinto | $6.2M | ~1.5 | ~0.00 | Alpine had good testing | Uncertain form |

**Recommendation:** Consider swapping Hulkenberg → Lawson or Lindblad at the Round 1 run, depending on FP1/FP2 data. Hulkenberg's combination of low xPts AND high price crash probability makes him the clearest transfer target. However, this should be confirmed with updated simulations at the actual run.

- Transfer confidence: **MEDIUM** — data supports a change but alternatives aren't dramatically better. Need FP1/FP2 data.

### DRS Boost Decision
**Russell remains the clear DRS Boost target.**
- Highest xPts (27.5)
- Mercedes suspected fastest team
- 19% ownership = differential advantage
- Autopilot chip for Round 1 will auto-assign to highest scorer anyway, but Russell should be the default

- DRS Boost confidence: **HIGH** — Russell is the highest-ceiling pick. Autopilot provides insurance.

### Chip Decision: Autopilot for Round 1
- Round 1 has maximum uncertainty (new regulations, no race data)
- Dry weather reduces the case for No Negative
- Autopilot removes DRS Boost assignment risk — the game auto-assigns to the highest scorer
- Strategy document already planned Autopilot for Round 1
- **No reason to deviate from this plan**

- Chip confidence: **HIGH** — perfect use case for Autopilot (maximum uncertainty weekend).

## Decisions Made (THIS RUN — preliminary)
- **Transfers:** NONE YET. Deferred to Round 1 run (March 7, 00:00 GMT) when FP1/FP2 data and updated simulations are available. Hulkenberg is flagged as the prime transfer target.
- **DRS Boost:** George Russell (unchanged, default). Autopilot chip will override if needed.
- **Chip:** Autopilot planned — will be applied at Round 1 run via browser.

## Current Team Lineup (unchanged)

| Slot | Pick | Price | xPts | DRS Boost |
|------|------|-------|------|-----------|
| Driver 1 | George Russell | $27.4M | 27.5 | ✅ 2x |
| Driver 2 | Charles Leclerc | $22.8M | 22.3 | |
| Driver 3 | Oliver Bearman | $7.4M | 5.2 | |
| Driver 4 | Nico Hulkenberg | $6.8M | 0.8 | ⚠️ |
| Driver 5 | Valtteri Bottas | $5.9M | 4.3 | |
| Constructor 1 | Ferrari | $23.3M | 56.6 | |
| Constructor 2 | Racing Bulls | $6.3M | ~8.8 | |

**Budget remaining:** $0.1M
**Free transfers remaining:** 3
**Chips remaining:** Autopilot (planned R1), Limitless (planned R2), No Negative, Wildcard, 3X Boost, Final Fix — ALL 6 AVAILABLE

## Next Scheduled Run
**Round:** 1 — Australian GP (Melbourne)
**Cron set to:** `0 0 7 3 *`
**Runs at:** 00:00 GMT, Saturday March 7, 2026
**Reason:** Qualifying at 05:00 GMT. Minus 5 hours = 00:00 GMT. This is the ACTUAL Round 1 execution run with FP1/FP2 data.

## Issues & Notes
1. **Browser unavailable this run.** Could not access f1fantasytools.com or fantasy.formula1.com. All analysis based on local files and web search. The Round 1 run MUST have browser access to execute changes and apply the Autopilot chip.
2. **This run was 8 days early.** It served as a pre-round research and scheduling run. The real execution happens at the next scheduled run on March 7.
3. **f1fantasytools data from report only.** The pre-prepared f1fantasytools-report.md contained pre-season Testing simulation data. Updated race-specific simulations (Post-FP1/FP2) will be available at the Round 1 run.
4. **Bottas grid penalty confirmed.** 5-place penalty at Melbourne. Factored into analysis — may slightly help with positions gained.
5. **Hulkenberg is the clear weak link.** The Round 1 run should prioritize checking updated xPts data and executing a transfer if the data supports it. Top candidates: Lawson, Lindblad.
6. **Chrome extension must be connected** for the March 7 run. Josh should ensure the browser extension is active before the scheduled execution.
